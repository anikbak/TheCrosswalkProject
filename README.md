# The Crosswalk Project
The Crosswalk Project will try to develop a close-to-universal system of crosswalks between different occupational, industrial and geographic levels at which various datasets are constructed. The eventual aim to construct a dynamically evolving map between these systems that will aid researchers in easily matching datasets. 

* Geography: A dynamic map that tracks places at _at least_ the county level, to allow users to map observations across datasets at each point in time.
* Industry: A dynamic map between SIC87 to NAICSxx, xx = 1997,2002,2007,2012,2017 and the upcoming 2022 when released to start with, to be expanded to include NACE Rev 2 and newer as well as SITC. Some of these already exist, but in a deeply fragmented state.
* Occupation: A dynamic map between OCCxx codes available in IPUMS Census and CPS data and the BLS SOC codes to start with.
